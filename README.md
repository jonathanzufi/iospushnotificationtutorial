# iOS Push Notification sample

This is the code sample to accompany my Medium article on sending iOS push notifications from nodeJS. 

See the article on how to configure all the dependencies which are defined in the sample as constants. 

Please contact me with any questions or flames to @shrineofapple.

Thanks!

--Jonathan.
